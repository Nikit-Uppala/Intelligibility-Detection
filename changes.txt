- to store the scores and fit gaussian.
V1 - discarding the negative values
V2 - very small values in place of negatives


## Some conclusions:
total maching : 111
total non-matching : 11990

This was probably the reason why the plot matching was weird :-(

1) Try to fit a gaussian on the points for matching and non-matchng and visualize it
